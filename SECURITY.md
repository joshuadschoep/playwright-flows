## Reporting a Vulnerability

Possible vulnerabilities can be reported to `joshuaschoep@gmail.com`.

Please do the following:

- Provide a clear description of the vulnerability.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue.
- If possible, suggest a potential fix or mitigation.
- If it exists, a CVE code and description.

This is an open-source project with one maintainer, so I'm afraid security reporting will come at a free-time basis for me.

However, standard protocols like dependabot, static scanning, AI code review, and secret scanning are enabled across this project. Security requirements, especially critical, will also take priority over other requests.
